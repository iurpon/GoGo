Hello there. This is my first project. I’m looking for a job java junior(middle) developer. And I found the technical task on the internet and now I’m trying to realize it. So, this is the task:
Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) without frontend.
The task is:
Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.
•	2 types of users: admin and regular users
•	Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
•	Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
•	Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
•	Only one vote counted per user
•	If user votes again the same day:
o	If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.
o	If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
Each restaurant provides new menu each day.
As a result, provide a link to github repository.
It should contain the code and README.md with API documentation and curl commands to get data for voting and vote.
The task isn’t finish yet.  I still a lot of work to do. But application can be already be started and with mock authorization (1 admin and 5 users) do action for users and admin
